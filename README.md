# Cirrhosis Prediction
This project aims to predict the status of liver disease using various clinical features through machine learning models. The dataset includes 18 clinical features such as age, sex, bilirubin levels, and other relevant health indicators. We performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and splitting the dataset for training and testing. Multiple models were trained and evaluated, including multinomial logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting models. To facilitate predictions, we developed a RESTful API using Plumber in R, allowing users to input clinical data and receive liver disease status predictions. The API endpoint is hosted locally and can be accessed via HTTP POST requests, making the model accessible for practical use in predicting liver disease status based on patient data. The project includes steps for data preparation, model training, performance evaluation, and deployment, ensuring a comprehensive approach to solving the prediction problem.
